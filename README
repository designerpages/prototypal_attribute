PrototypalAttribute
===================

Give your models javascript-esque prototypal methods. When accessing an attribute
on the prototypal object, the attribute's value is returned if not nil.
Otherwise, the "linked" object's attribute value is returned.

Example
=======

class Clipping
  has_many :saved_clippings
end

class SavedClipping
  belongs_to :clipping
  
  include Prototypal
  prototypal_attributes(:clipping, :title, :description)
end

clipping = Clipping.new(:title => "Base Title", :description => "Base description")
saved_clipping = SavedClipping.new(
  :clipping => clipping, 
  :description => "Saved clipping description"
)

saved_clipping.title
=> "Base Title"

saved_clipping.description
=> "Saved clipping description"
